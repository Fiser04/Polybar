# Fiser's Polybar
> [!NOTE]
> I use pulseaudio for audio and brightnessctl for brightness.


> [!TIP]
> If the temperature does not work run polybar -r and look for temperature, probably it will say something like acpitz is unknown and it shows what it knows, edit config.ini and in [module/temperature] find zone-type, rewrite it to what it knows.

  Copy both to ~/.config/polybar/ or wherever you have the config for polybar
